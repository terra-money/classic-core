# Getting started

This section will guide the reader to install, deploy, and interact with the Terra Protocol and its toolkits.

> NOTE: Though customized for Terra Core, these docs largely mirror the setup documentation for the Cosmos SDK, available at [https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/docs/](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/docs/).
